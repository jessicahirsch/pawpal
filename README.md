### Planetary Zoology

You are Space web developers, dispatched from Earth to the distant planet Solaris. After years of study, the scientific mission has not progressed.
The zoologists have collected data, but are unable to share their data with the world, and their notebooks are so filled with notes that they don't
have the capacity to add information about new species they discover. 

Use the skills we've been pracitcing over the last week, and create a database to house their information, and create an Express app with RESTful routes to catalogue the data these zoologists have uncovered. 

Finally, build a form that will allow these overburdened zoologists to add new species to their database, update existing records, and delete records if they need.

###STEPS: 
1. Create a database, and then run the seeds file.  Make sure you're installing proper pacakges: Express, Mustache-Express, pg-promise, and body-parser.

2. Create a route in your Express app that renders a list of all creatures in the database.

3. Create a route in your Express app that renders a list of all creatures on one planet.

4. Create a route to add a new species to the database, and create a form that facilitates this POST request. 

5. Create a route that updates information on a species, along with a form to make the submission. 

6. Create a route to delete a species.
